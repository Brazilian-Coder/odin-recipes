      Answering the age-old question of whether the chicken or egg came first is
      easy—evolutionary biology tells us it was the egg. But trying to figure
      out the order of appearance of the soufflé omelette versus the more
      classic soufflé is a bit harder.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 large eggs, separated</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 ounces (55g) grated Gruyère or cheddar cheese, divided</li>
      <li>Minced fresh chives (optional)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, beat egg yolks with a generous pinch of salt and some
        freshly ground black pepper until well mixed.
      </li>

      <li>
        In a separate large mixing bowl, using a whisk, electric hand blender,
        or stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites until
        firm, glossy peaks form.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add half of the beaten egg whites to yolks and stir well until whites
        are thoroughly combined and soufflé base has a looser consistency. Mix
        in half the cheese as well as the chives, if using. Add remaining beaten
        whites, and, using a silicone spatula, gently fold them into the soufflé
        base just until well combined.
      </li>

      <li>
        In a 9- or 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat until
        foaming. Scrape soufflé base into pan. Using spatula, spread soufflé
        base into even circle and smooth out the surface. Cover and cook until
        bottom of omelette is browned and top is just barely set (or even a
        little loose still, if you prefer). Scatter remaining cheese on top;
        cover once more and cook until cheese starts to melt, about 1 minute
        longer.
      </li>

      <li>
        Carefully slide the omelette out of the pan and onto a warm serving
        plate, folding it over itself. Serve right away.
      </li>
    </ol>
