        <!-- https://www.seriouseats.com/omelette-souffle-with-cheese -->
        <dd>
          Much simpler than a classic soufflé, this light and fluffy omelette is
          cooked in a skillet and requires little more than eggs, cheese, and a
          few extra minutes.

        <dt>Brazilian Cheese Bread (Pao de Queijo)</dt>
        <!-- https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/98554/brazilian-cheese-bread-pao-de-queijo/ -->
        <dd>
          Pao de queijo are yummy gluten-free, wheat-free breads that are good
          for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Serve them plain
          or with marinara sauce. For more variety, try adding an herb
          seasonings, such as Italian seasoning, or try substituting other
          cheeses for the Parmesan.

        <dt>Corn Cake</dt>

        <dd>
          Out of all the things made with fresh corn, Sweet Corn Cake might be
          my favorite! It is a breeze to make and goes great with a cup of
          coffe.
